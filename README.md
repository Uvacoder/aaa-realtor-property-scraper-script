# realtor_property_scraper
This script is built to scrape property data from realtor. We have used ScrapingBee to render JS on this website. It scrapes listings for targetted postal codes from targetCodes.txt file.

# Setup:
This script is written in python using following libraries:
- scrapy
- scrapingbee

# Usage:
1) Just put the target postal codes in targetCodes.txt file
2) Enter your API key in the script
3) Run the script and it will start scraping

Note: You would need to put your API for ScrapingBee on line no. 8.
